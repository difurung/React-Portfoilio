      <p>
        Hello! My name is Denart Ifurung. My background is in biology, organic
        chemistry, and medicine. Since I was young, I have always gravitated
        towards areas of study that involve the diagnosis of a problem and
        finding its resolution. That is very likely why I find myself currently
        delving into the world of computer programming and web development. It
        is the combination of technical analysis and problem solving, combined
        with the opportunity to create something that uniquely your own that
        fascinates me. While this may be a new direction for me, with its own
        set of distinctive challenges, I look forward to taking this journey,
        wherever it leads.
