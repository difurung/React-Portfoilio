  <p>
    Though I am interested in programming and web development as a whole, both
    my academic and personal health experiences have led to a particular focus
    in healthcare. In medicine, communication is of paramount importance.
    Whether it is between the patients, doctors, their staff, or even between
    medical devices and diagnostic tools, there needs to be a robust, efficient
    line of communication in order to ensure the patient's best interests. The
    internet and web communication are quickly becoming cornerstones for this.
    The challenges we faced the past few years only exacerbated this need and
    revealed the importance remote communication can have in healthcare. As
    such, I would love to work within the healthcare industry developing
    solutions that streamline these lines of communications. I believe that
    technology not only has the potential to make things more convenient for
    medical professionals, beyond that I am truly convinced that it can have a
    positive impact on patient morbidity and mortality, and improve clinical
    outcomes in general.
